スタンフォード大学図書館の展示が凄いです！
今の時代、オンラインで閲覧できるのはとてもありがたいですね。

There is a magic in information graphics. Maps float you above the land for a bird’s eye view. Timelines arrange memories on the page for all to see. Diagrams reveal the parts inside without requiring disassembly, or incision.  

>❡ Data visualization leapt from its Enlightenment origins and into the minds of the general public in the 1760s. It cast more powerful spells throughout the following century. By 1900, modern science, technology, and social movements had all benefited from this new quantitative art. Its inventions include the timeline, bar chart, and thematic map. Together, these innovations changed how we understand the world and our place within it. Data visualization helped a new imagination emerge, wired to navigate a reality much bigger than any single person’s lived experience.  

>❡ The sections in this exhibition examine information graphics that show space, time, nature, and society. Many are beautiful. Each is a unique way of seeing still worth our attention. —RJ Andrews, guest curator

French civil engineer [Charles Joseph Minard](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/dataviz/feature/french-chartography) elevated the flow map into an artform. His bespoke color, annotation, and cartogram designs brought complex datasets to life. Minard inspired decades of French investment into thematic mapping, especially the eighteen Albums de Statistique Graphique published by France’s Ministry of Public Works. Their hundreds of thematic maps showed dense datasets with careful encoding and exquisite printing. Analytic and aesthetic heights have not yet again been achieved on such a massive scale.  

Cotton Imports in 1858 and 1861  

>Minard visualized the imports of cotton to Europe over several years using the same graphic language: flow width represents quantity and color indicates exporter. Quantity annotations are individually angled to indicate the direction of flow. The six-part story reveals how the U.S. Civil War disrupted America’s near-monopoly on cotton production. By the time the war concluded, production in Egypt and India had increased to fill the gap.  

>Minard’s basemap is heavily distorted to better feature the data flows. The coastline of the United States is flattened because its detail is not needed. England is enlarged to accommodate its massive imports, while Ireland, a visual impediment, is completely missing. Africa is squished in service of Indian shipments.  

>The instance shown, created in the middle of Minard’s cotton project, compares the latest available data of 1861 to Minard’s first rendition of 1858. The final series installment presents three years side-by-side: 1858, 1864, and 1865. Always the civil engineer, Minard’s last notes forecast the future impacts of steam power and the opening of the Suez Canal, which was already under construction.

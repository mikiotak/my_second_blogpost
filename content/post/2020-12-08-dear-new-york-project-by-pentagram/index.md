> Since March 2020, New York City has undergone profound change due to Covid-19 and the mandatory stay-at-home orders. To mark this moment, and envision what comes next, Pentagram partner Giorgia Lupi and her team have created a new online experience entitled “Dear New York…”  to help capture New Yorkers’ feelings about the pandemic’s impact on life in the city.

> The project was born out of Lupi’s personal desire to find a way to memorialize the city’s identity before Covid-19, and create a type of vessel for hopes about its future. The team began the design process by thinking expansively about what makes New York City, New York City. Key references and ideas quickly emerged. First, the team wanted to allude to the often random, unplanned occurrences—sidewalk collision, chance encounters, overheard conversations—that make living in a major metropolis so vibrant, and that were sorely missed during the city-wide quarantine. A simple content framework was devised around the prompts “I miss you for…” and “I hope you will become…”, inviting users to contribute their reflections on both a nostalgic past, and an ideal, reinvented future. The prompts are broad enough to capture all different types of sentiments, both related to Covid-19 and not.

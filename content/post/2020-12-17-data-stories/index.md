[A podcast on data visualization with Enrico Bertini and Moritz Stefaner](https://datastori.es/archive/)

>This is the first episode of a mini-series of Data Visualization agencies. After so many years producing this podcast we realized we never really focused on agencies and we decided itâ€™s time to rectify! Agencies have slowly become one of the most relevant realities of the data visualization ecosystem and business landscape. In this first episode, we have Thomas Clever to talk about [Clever Franke](https://www.cleverfranke.com) and Benjamin Wiederkehr from Interactive Things. They have been around for more than 10 years and they have produced some really amazing work.

> I am really happy to be able to launch a new visualisation project called 'Filmographics'. It is a project that I have had in gestation for quite a while but is finally possible to release now that my book has been printed/published and the digital companion site is also openly accessible to all (as of today). Filmographics is driven by a curiosity to explore the shape of success across the careers of movie stars displaying the ebb and flow of the fortunes for a selection of 60 prominent actors and directors across the decades.

> This project has been primarily developed to offer a case-study demonstration to run alongside the book's release. Over on the digital companion site you can find a comprehensive account of each major stage of the design process. Originally intended for the print version of the book, this detailed narrative had to be taken out due to space limitations. You will find ‘case study’ sections from Chapters 2 through to 10 describing all the ideas, challenges and choices made during the creation of this work.

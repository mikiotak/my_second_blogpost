Just in time for awards season, [the AFI’s 100 Most Memorable Movie Quotes](https://www.afi.com/afi-lists/) have been diagrammed.In 2005, the American Film Institute polled a jury of 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians to come up with 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes, a list of the most memorable movie quotes in Hollywood history.   

Those same quotes turned into 100 simple charts by designer Flowing Data’s Nathan Yau, though? It makes Hollywood’s dusty old chestnuts seem awesome and fresh again. To convert cinematic sentiments into understandable diagrams, Yau has used every technique in the charting arsenal: pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, flow charts, and more.

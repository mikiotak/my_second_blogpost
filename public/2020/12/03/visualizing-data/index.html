<p>Welcome to the digital companion site for the book, &lsquo;Visualising Data: A Handbook for Data Driven Design (Second Edition)&rsquo; by Andy Kirk, published by Sage and available to buy now! This is a special sub-site of visualisingdata.com dedicated to providing readers with additional references and resources to supplement their learning from the book&rsquo;s content. If you&rsquo;ve not yet bought the book, you can learn more about who it is aimed at, see an overview of the topics covered and structure of contents, read through some sample excerpts and find links to the various places you can buy a copy.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-toolkits">CHAPTER TOOLKITS</h1>
<p>To accompany each book chapter, there are up to four sections of additional digital contents for you to browse through:</p>
<p>Explore the field: The ‘Reading’ contents offer a curated, and growing, collection of recommended links to web articles, papers and texts, and other relevant visualisation references associated with the topics covered by each chapter. They are provided to supplement the contents of the book, to expand your knowledge and reinforce your learning about visualising data. This collection of reading materials will be continually refined as and when new references are discovered.
Try this yourself: The ‘Exercises’ sections offer a range of practical tasks for you to revise, reflect, and refine your skills and substantiate your learning from the book. The nature of the challenges offered varies, with some involve sketching, several requiring you to evaluate visualisation design choices, and others relating to working with data. These exercises are for you to try out alongside the topics covered in each chapter of the book.
See data visualisation in action: The ‘Case Study’ contents provide a detailed behind-the-scenes write-up of a data visualisation in practice. The first case study design process concerns the development of Andy Kirk’s &lsquo;Filmographics&rsquo; project, created to demonstrate the practical application of the process proposed in the first edition of this book in 2016 to. In the coming months, a new project will be launched (more details to follow soon!) and a second accompanying case study write-up will be published. This will be supplemented by a series of video diaries showing the process in action and offering direct insight into Andy’s thought processes, challenges, mistakes, and decisions along the way.
Book visuals: The ‘Figures’ sections provide details, links to sources, and downloadable images for every figure published in the book. This will be especially useful for readers who are looking to incorporate figures from the book in to their teaching materials.
SUPPLEMENTARY RESOURCES</p>
<p>Across other parts of visualisingdata.com you will find many further sources of valuable data visualisation references and content:</p>
<p>Visualisation tools: The Resources collection provides an organised catalogue of over 360 data visualisation tools, applications and libraries currently available in the field.
The &lsquo;Chartmaker Directory&rsquo;: This is a project developed to tie together two fundamental perspectives of data visualisation development: charts and tools. The directory offers hundreds of crowd-sourced references that help to answer the perennial curiosities: Which charts can be made in which tools? Which tools can make which charts? This growing directory of examples and technical solutions will help all practitioners with the process of chart building.
Monthly digests: After the end of each month, these &lsquo;Best of…&rsquo; posts collate some of the standout projects, articles, and learning resources that have emerged from across the field during the previous period. They have been published every month going all the way back to February 2010, so there’s plenty of archive content for you to browse through! Visit the blog and select the &lsquo;Collections&rsquo; tab.
Need more help grasping this subject? Have a team of colleagues or a group of students who could benefit from some expert guidance? Maybe you would prefer to learn through teaching rather than reading? If that&rsquo;s the case, then why not visit the Visualising Data training page to learn about the various public and private training courses offered around the world by Andy Kirk.</p>

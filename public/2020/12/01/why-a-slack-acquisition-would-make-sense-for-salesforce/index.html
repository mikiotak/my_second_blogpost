<p>Salesforce is reportedly in “advanced talks” with Slack over a potential acquisition — a deal that would be a good fit for both organizations, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Employee engagement: Why a deal makes sense for Salesforce </p>
<p>At first glance, Salesforce seems like a slightly awkward fit for a suitor, given its core focus on software that supports business-to-customer relationships.
“The first question that comes to mind with these reports is why would Salesforce be interested in acquiring Slack, given that — despite its acquisition of Quip four years ago — employee productivity and collaboration is outside its core domain,” said Raul Castanon a senior analyst at 451 Research/S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>An acquisition now of Slack would provide Salesforce with an immediate route to expand its focus on customer-facing tools and address the market for employee engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time, Slack has been creating a more open collaboration space, with the launch of Slack Connect this year making it easier for a business using Slack to interact with external organizations, including partners and clients.  </p>
<p>“The potential of Slack Connect and creating a B2B collaboration network would also jive well with Salesforce&rsquo;s business enablement story,” said Ashenden.</p>

<p>even if Slack will not replace HR, sales, marketing, expense, customer support software; it will become one of the primary interfaces for these applications. Anyone who wants to own the SaaS application space, would love to own Slack and be able to control the interface or gateway to competing apps. If Salesforce owned Slack, it would be able to understand which SaaS products are getting great usage and engagement via Slack plugin metrics of that product. Salesforce applications will be able to integrate tightly with Slack. Salesforce will continue to the leading system of record(SoR) and Slack will be the system of engagement(SoE).</p>

      <description>Computerworld
Salesforce is reportedly in “advanced talks” with Slack over a potential acquisition — a deal that would be a good fit for both organizations, according to analysts.
Employee engagement: Why a deal makes sense for Salesforce At first glance, Salesforce seems like a slightly awkward fit for a suitor, given its core focus on software that supports business-to-customer relationships. “The first question that comes to mind with these reports is why would Salesforce be interested in acquiring Slack, given that — despite its acquisition of Quip four years ago — employee productivity and collaboration is outside its core domain,” said Raul Castanon a senior analyst at 451 Research/S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</description>

      <description>Clay was more interested in getting to the right answer than in being right. And for him, getting to the right answer started with asking the right questions. For instance:
 What does the ascendance of a new generation of straight-to-consumer disrupters tell us about how innovation is evolving? What are the sources of disruption that every com- pany must monitor? Is disruption always the right strategy — or not? Why have companies not gotten better at solving the innovator’s dilemma two decades after Clay first helped us understand how disruption occurs?</description>
